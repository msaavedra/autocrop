This is a python package to crop smaller photos out of a larger image and
optionally rotate crooked photos.  The typical use would be to scan several
photos in a flatbed scanner, and use autocrop to find the photos, deskew them,
and save them independently.

The package requires the Python Imaging Library.  It is shipped with most Linux
distributions, but can be downloaded if needed for Linux and Windows from
http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/ .

Basic usage of the module is as follows:

# Begin code here #######################

from PIL import Image
from autocrop import MultiPartImage, Background

# A saved scan with the scanner empty.
blank_img = Image.open('/path/to/blank/scan')

# A saved scan with multiple photos loaded in the scanner
scan_img = Image.open('/path/to/scanned/image')

background = Background().load_from_image(blank_img, dpi=200)
scan = MultiPartImage(scan_img, background, dpi=200)
for index, photo in enumerate(scan):
    photo.save('/path/to/cropped/image-%d.jpg' % index)

# End code here #########################

Also included is a simple linux command-line script to initiate a scan and
handle the cropping.  It should be considered a demonstration most of the
capabilities of the package, not a utility for general wide-spread use.  This
script has the additional dependency of my cross_platform package, which is
available at https://github.com/msaavedra/cross_platform .
